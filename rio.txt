#waypoint <code> [<relative_to>,]<x>,<y>: Alternative to station with 0-length platforms. For routing.
#label <dir>: Where <dir> is one of N, NE, E, etc. Defines where the label is relative to the station.

#platform <number> <dir> <line> <side>: A platform called "number" (can be any string), with direction <dir> on line <line> and with the platform on <side>: N (none, for straight-through lines), L, R or B (both)
#track <station>-<platform> <station>-<platform> <line>: A section of track. Will layer on top of anything behind it with an outline effect.
