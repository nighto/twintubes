### Instructions ###
#
#line <name> <color>: Defines a line. Name is symbolic only.
#station <code> <title> [<relative_to>,]<x>,<y>: Starts a station stanza. Code is used to refer to it later.
#waypoint <code> [<relative_to>,]<x>,<y>: Alternative to station with 0-length platforms. For routing.
#label <dir>: Where <dir> is one of N, NE, E, etc. Defines where the label is relative to the station.
#label_offset <x> <y>: For fine-tuning of label placement on the trickier stations.
#platform <number> <dir> <line> <side>: A platform called "number" (can be any string), with direction <dir> on line <line> and with the platform on <side>: N (none, for straight-through lines), L, R or B (both)
#track <station>-<platform> <station>-<platform> <line>: A section of track. Will layer on top of anything behind it with an outline effect.
#subtrack <station>-<platform> <station>-<platform> <line>: Like track, but will not use an outline and so will merge with things behind it. For points, generally.
